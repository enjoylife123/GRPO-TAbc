This two-stage optimization approach begins with the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) in the first stage, which efficiently explores the solution space by optimizing relative performances among solutions within the same group, rather than relying on absolute evaluations. In the second stage, the Tabu Search enhanced Artificial Bee Colony (TSABC) algorithm is employed to conduct a detailed and fine-grained search within the promising regions identified by GRPO. This method leverages the strengths of both algorithms: GRPO's ability to rapidly locate high-potential areas through relative performance comparisons, and TSABC's capability to refine and discover the optimal solution by avoiding local optima traps. Consequently, this combined strategy not only accelerates the convergence towards near-optimal solutions but also ensures the accuracy and robustness of the final outcome.
